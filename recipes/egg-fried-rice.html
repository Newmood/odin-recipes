        <ol>
            <li>Smash the garlic and then cut it to avoid it slipping out, finely chop the shallots and spring onion, and cut chilies too!</li>
            <blockquote>It is good to have the veggies finely chopped so that everything is of similar size. When enjoying the meal, every spoon of egg fried rice will have a good mix of every element.</blockquote>
            <li>Crack the eggs and whisk them properly.</li>
            <li>Light up the fire, let the wok heat for a while then pour oil little by the sides coating it nicely.</li>
            <li>After heating the oil for a while, put in garlic and shallot, stir till light brown then pour the whisked eggs and again stir well. </li>
            <li>Add rice to this when eggs are almost done.</li>
            <li>Add some soy sauce by the sides and mix it well.</li>
            <li>Now add some sesame oil and stir.</li>
            <li>Add spring onion and chilies now.</li>
            <blockquote>Reason for adding spring onion towards the end is because it can otherwise get cooked quickly and become soggy.</blockquote>
